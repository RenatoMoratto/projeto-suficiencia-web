# Projeto SuficiÃªncia Web

Project made as a sufficiency assessment for the full-stack web programming course (AS64A).

## Features

- User registration
- User login
- User search
- Only users with an active session in the system (logged in) can register new users and perform a user search.

## System Architecture 

The system should be implemented with 4 layers, as illustrated in Figure 1. The technical requirements are detailed below, considering each layer of the system: 

**Front-end:** must be implemented using the React.js front-end library. All communication with the  Back-end must be carried out through HTTP requests, characterizing a Single-Page Application - SPA; 

**Back-end:** must be implemented using Express.js. Communication with the Front-end must follow the Restful route pattern. This server will have direct read-only access to the database. The writing processes must be carried out through the writing service in the database. This server must also implement a route cache system, using the REDIS system;

**Writing service:** it must be implemented with Node.js, it will have direct access to the database, and the communication with the other services must be carried out through a message queue system or event flow;

**Database:** any database management system chosen by the students can be used.
